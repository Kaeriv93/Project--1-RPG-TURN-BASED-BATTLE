# Title: RPG Turn-based Battle System
Creating a turn based battle system based off Final Fantasy 7. The player will take control of 2 heroes and defeat the boss. These actions include attacking, using magic, as well as healing. 


# Technologies 
Used: HTML, Javascript, jQuery, CSS

Getting Started:
https://kaeriv93.github.io/Project--1-RPG-TURN-BASED-BATTLE/

I really wanted to grasp the feel of Final Fantasy 7, so I wanted to be able to implement magic, soundfx, and moving characters. These characters are actually given the illusion of being animated because all the files are actually gifs. I was able to find a good deal of them online, those that weren't possible to find, I had to create them using sprite resource sheets. Hopefully as I develop my skills, the gifs will look sharper and professional. 
The game is a fair bit loud so I do recommend lower your volume.

Using magic to defeat the enemey.



# Next Steps: 
As I begin to learn more I would like to implement different features such as the usage of moving the characters, having dialogue, using a more complex magic system. In builiding this project I learned that there is so much that you can do with Javascript and I can't wait to implement changes as I continue to grow and learn!
