1. This is the site I used to grab my sprites and turn them into gifs for animations.

2. This is where I made some custom gifs, I also found most online(google) and used the ones from the earlier link as well.
So some gifs that I wanted to edit I would go into this link and literally splice up the gif into individual frames.
From there I would make the delay in between pics faster or slower. And honestly sometimes it would break or make the character look sloppy.
I really want to implement a lot of animations later on, but only time can tell and I will focus on my functionality as well.
Also it takes so much time to get it perfect so this will definitely be a stretch goal
